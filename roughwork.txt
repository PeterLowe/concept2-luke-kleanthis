Market analysis
similar games , typical customer, expected sales
[LK
some similar games to ours would be the original assasin creed trilogy, 
world exploration games like watchdogs and for honor.

the typical customer we are aiming for is the type of player 
that likes to play games that involve a element of being stealthy, that has 
a lot of combat and that would have an interest in space games aswell as midevil gameplay.

our expected sales have been calculated to 3.6 million euros. 
we are expecting the game to cost us 500 thousand euros.
this will leave us with a 3.1 million profit.
