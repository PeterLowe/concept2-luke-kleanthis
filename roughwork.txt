Market analysis
similar games , typical customer, expected sales
[LK]
some similar games to ours would be the original assasins creed games, for honor,
watch dogs and no mans sky.

the typical customer we are aiming to target is the type of player who likes big long 
campgains, multiplayer aspect and space exploration, also the element of being stealthy

we are expecting to reach a total of 3.6 million euros of total sales.
the game is costing us 500 thousand euros to design and create.
this will leave us with a nice 3.1 million euro profit.
